#### Intro
Quality letterheads are a problem for non-technical users. So we've built (really hacked together) a slightly easier solution over the last 3 days. 

You'll see that it's not so perfect and could use some improvement. So your contributions are welcome.

Please raise your issues outside the known issues below.

#### Usage

Install to your site and use.

#### Known Issues
1. Clearing the Image does not get rid of the image url. Workaround: reload the browser

#### Roadmap
1. Correct Image refresh issue
2. Add settings to enable / disable
3. V2 - WYSIWYG Editor: Drag and drop image + image positioning + styling (I doubt we'll work on this soon)
